# Goal

We all wonder how much our friends value our friendship. An easy way to do so is let them solve any one of the memories we had together.
The game functions on that same principle. All you need to do is load a photo of a memory from your android phone and let your friend solve the jumbled puzzle.
The amount of time left on the timer and the number of hints taken would determine how much your friend values your friendship.
Let's see if they value it as much as you do.

PS Remember this game is just for fun and not a real measure ment of value of friendship. It is actually just a test of your friend's memory and picture retention capabilities.
